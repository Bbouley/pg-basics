## Node pg

### Intro

So far we've been looking at SQL databases, and express routes, but seperately. Today we'll start to work on how to integrate SQL queries into our Javascript code. This will allow us to start querying a database and make changes within javascript applications. Once we've covered this, you can start using pg on the server-side to create database queries within routes. With this, you can then start building your own API's. To start with though, we'll keep it simple.
